# eos-apm
This a dev branch of APM, you can test new features and do demo in this branch.

In order no to confuse yourself and myself, here are the instructions:

1. Create a activity in the project of dev branch, for example, to demonstarte sliding tab feature, you create a slidingTabActivity 

2. Add new features or whatever you like in the project

3. Add a Button in the Mainactivity, and name of the button can be bt3, bt4...

3. Create a OnClickListener for that button, and add the method **startActivity** to invoke the slidingTabActivity, so that everyone can test new features in this branch without messing the **MainActivity** up
4. If you like to upload a snapshot of the new feature, put it in ./ApmPowerManager/pic/, and add som instruction or explaination in this README file
